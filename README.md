# unmanjarify
Debloat ManjaroOS and make it more like a standard arch desktop.

## NOTE: Specifically made for Manjaro KDE-Plasma but should work on other desktop environments.

### What does it do?

#### Removes annoying pre-installed manjaro bloatware:
ark, audiocd-kio, elisa, ffmpegthumbs, filelight, gwenview, kamera, kcalc,
keditbookmarks, kfind, khelpcenter, skanlite, spectacle, yakuake, okular,
dolphin-plugins, manjaro-hello, manjaro-application-utility,
plymouth-theme-manjaro, plymouth-kcm, unarchiver,
pamac-tray-icon-plasma, pamac-gtk3, pamac-cli

#### Changes zsh to bash and makes console look like normal kde-plasma konsole.

#### Installs GRUB and fixes some boot bugs.

#### Removes default firefox page which was 'manjaro.org'
